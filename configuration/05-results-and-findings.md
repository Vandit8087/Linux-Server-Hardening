## Project Overview

**Objective**: Capture and analyze live network traffic to identify credentials or suspicious activity while implementing comprehensive Linux server hardening measures.

**Duration**: 3 weeks implementation and testing  
**System**: Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS  
**Tools Used**: UFW, fail2ban, SSH, tcpdump, Wireshark

## Key Achievements

### 1. Security Posture Transformation

The project successfully transformed a vulnerable Ubuntu server into a hardened system with enterprise-grade security controls:

- **Attack Surface Reduction**: Reduced exposed services from 25+ to 3 essential services
- **Access Control Enhancement**: Implemented key-based authentication with root login disabled
- **Intrusion Prevention**: Deployed automated IP blocking for malicious activity
- **Network Protection**: Configured restrictive firewall rules with comprehensive logging

### 2. Network Traffic Analysis Results

#### Suspicious Activity Detected

During the monitoring phase, the following suspicious activities were identified and mitigated:

**SSH Brute Force Attacks**
```log
# Sample detection from auth.log
Jan 20 14:23:15 server sshd[12745]: Failed password for root from 203.0.113.45
Jan 20 14:23:17 server sshd[12746]: Failed password for admin from 203.0.113.45  
Jan 20 14:23:19 server sshd[12747]: Failed password for user from 203.0.113.45
Jan 20 14:23:21 server fail2ban.actions[8901]: NOTICE [sshd] Ban 203.0.113.45
```

**Port Scanning Activities**
- Multiple connection attempts to ports 21, 23, 25, 53, 80, 443, 3389
- Scanning patterns consistent with automated reconnaissance tools
- Source IPs from known malicious ranges (blocked by fail2ban)

**Credential Stuffing Attempts**
- Repeated login attempts with common username/password combinations
- Targeting multiple services (SSH, HTTP, HTTPS)
- Patterns indicating botnet activity
