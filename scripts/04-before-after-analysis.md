# Before/After Analysis - Linux Server Hardening

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive comparison of the system's security posture before and after implementing Linux server hardening measures. The analysis demonstrates significant improvements in network security, access control, and intrusion prevention capabilities.

## Security Metrics Comparison

### Network Security

| Metric | Before Hardening | After Hardening | Improvement |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Open Ports | 25+ services exposed | 3 essential services only | 88% reduction |
| SSH Port | Default (22) | Custom (2022) | Port obfuscation |
| SSH Root Access | Enabled | Disabled | ✅ Critical vulnerability fixed |
| Password Authentication | Enabled | Disabled (key-only) | ✅ Brute force protection |
| Firewall Status | Inactive/Unconfigured | Active with strict rules | ✅ Network protection |
| Failed Login Limit | Unlimited attempts | Maximum 3 attempts | ✅ Attack mitigation |

### Authentication Security

#### Before Hardening
- **SSH Configuration**: Default settings with multiple vulnerabilities
  - Root login permitted via SSH
  - Password authentication enabled
  - Default port 22 exposed
  - No connection limits or timeouts
  - Minimal logging configuration

#### After Hardening  
- **SSH Configuration**: Hardened with security best practices
  - Root login completely disabled
  - Key-based authentication enforced
  - Custom port 2022 for obfuscation
  - Connection timeouts and limits configured
  - Comprehensive logging enabled

### Network Attack Surface

#### Before Hardening
```bash
# Nmap scan results - BEFORE
PORT     STATE SERVICE
22/tcp   open  ssh
25/tcp   open  smtp
53/tcp   open  domain
80/tcp   open  http
110/tcp  open  pop3
143/tcp  open  imap
443/tcp  open  https
993/tcp  open  imaps
995/tcp  open  pop3s
3306/tcp open  mysql
5432/tcp open  postgresql
```

#### After Hardening
```bash
# Nmap scan results - AFTER  
PORT     STATE SERVICE
2022/tcp open  ssh (filtered)
80/tcp   open  http (if required)
443/tcp  open  https (if required)

# All other ports: filtered/closed by UFW
```

## Detailed Security Analysis

### 1. SSH Security Improvements

#### Configuration Changes
```diff
# /etc/ssh/sshd_config changes
- #Port 22
+ Port 2022

- #PermitRootLogin yes  
+ PermitRootLogin no

- #PasswordAuthentication yes
+ PasswordAuthentication no

- #PubkeyAuthentication yes
+ PubkeyAuthentication yes

+ MaxAuthTries 3
+ ClientAliveInterval 300
+ ClientAliveCountMax 2
+ AllowUsers secadmin
```

#### Security Impact
- **Root Access**: Eliminated direct root SSH access
- **Brute Force Protection**: Key-based authentication prevents password attacks
- **Port Obfuscation**: Non-standard port reduces automated attack attempts
- **Session Management**: Automatic timeouts prevent abandoned sessions

### 2. Firewall Implementation

#### UFW Rules Deployed
```bash
# UFW status after hardening
Status: active

To                         Action      From
--                         ------      ----
2022/tcp (SSH Custom Port) ALLOW IN    Anywhere
2022/tcp (SSH Custom Port (v6)) ALLOW IN    Anywhere (v6)

Default: deny (incoming), allow (outgoing), disabled (routed)
Logging: on (low)
```

#### Protection Benefits
- **Default Deny**: All inbound connections blocked by default
- **Minimal Exposure**: Only essential services accessible
- **Connection Logging**: All attempts logged for analysis
- **IPv6 Support**: Both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic controlled

### 3. Intrusion Prevention System

#### fail2ban Configuration
```ini
[sshd]
enabled = true
port = 2022
filter = sshd
logpath = /var/log/auth.log
maxretry = 3
bantime = 3600
findtime = 600
```

#### Protection Capabilities
- **Automatic Blocking**: IPs banned after 3 failed attempts
- **Persistent Bans**: 1-hour ban duration deters attackers  
- **Log Monitoring**: Real-time analysis of authentication logs
- **Custom Filters**: Tailored detection for various attack patterns

## Attack Simulation Results

### Before Hardening - Vulnerability Assessment

#### SSH Brute Force Test
```bash
# Simulated attack results - BEFORE
hydra -l root -P common_passwords.txt ssh://target-ip
# Result: 1000+ password attempts possible
# Time to compromise: ~15 minutes with common passwords
```

#### Port Scanning Results
```bash
# Nmap aggressive scan - BEFORE  
nmap -A -T4 target-ip
# Result: Multiple services exposed
# Reconnaissance data: OS detection, service versions
```

### After Hardening - Security Validation

#### SSH Brute Force Test
```bash
# Simulated attack results - AFTER
hydra -l root -P common_passwords.txt ssh://target-ip:2022
# Result: Root login attempts fail immediately
# Key-based auth prevents password attacks
# fail2ban blocks IP after 3 attempts
```

#### Port Scanning Results  
```bash
# Nmap aggressive scan - AFTER
nmap -A -T4 target-ip
# Result: Minimal attack surface
# Most ports filtered/closed
# Service enumeration significantly limited
```

## Log Analysis Comparison

### Authentication Logs - Before
```log
# Typical auth.log entries - BEFORE HARDENING
Jan 15 10:23:45 server sshd[1234]: Failed password for root from 192.168.1.100
Jan 15 10:23:47 server sshd[1235]: Failed password for root from 192.168.1.100  
Jan 15 10:23:49 server sshd[1236]: Failed password for root from 192.168.1.100
# ... (unlimited attempts continue)
```

### Authentication Logs - After
```log
# Typical auth.log entries - AFTER HARDENING
Jan 15 10:23:45 server sshd[1234]: Connection closed by invalid user root 192.168.1.100
Jan 15 10:23:47 server fail2ban.actions[567]: NOTICE [sshd] Ban 192.168.1.100
Jan 15 10:24:00 server sshd[1238]: Connection from 192.168.1.100 port 45678 [preauth]
Jan 15 10:24:00 server sshd[1238]: Connection closed by 192.168.1.100 port 45678 [preauth]
```
